# Online Course Enrollment ERD

This project focuses on designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an Online Course Enrollment system. The ERD outlines the structure of the database, including entities, attributes, and relationships, to effectively manage course enrollments, students, and related data.

## Key Features of the ERD
- **Studentss**: Represents students info.
- **Courses**: Contains details about available courses.
- **Enrollments**: Tracks which students are enrolled in which courses.
- **Instructors**: Represents Instructors info.


## Future Steps
**Database Implementation**: Translate the ERD into a relational database schema.
